/**
 * The Connected Component Detection algorithm goes over a XnVDepthMap and fills
 * a XnVLabelMatrix object.
 * A Connected Component is defined in the following way:
 * Two neighboring pixels are in the same Connected Component iff
 * their absolute depth difference is smaller than a certain threshold.
 * This algorithm goes over the input XnVDepthMap, and finds all the
 * Connected Components, giving each of them a unique XnVObject::XnVLabel,
 * and updating the XnVLabelMatrix with the label in the position matching the pixel.
 * A pixel that doesn't belong to any Connected Component, either because it has
 * no depth, or because its Connected Component was smaller than the size threshold
 * and was therefore disregarded, gets label 0.
 * Any other Connected Component gets a label from 1 and onwards.
 * There may be lapses in the label numbering, since the numbering is done before
 * the Connected Components that are too small are removed.
 * This algorithm has no memory: running it on different XnVDepthMap
 * (even if it's the next frame) won't necessarily result in the
 * "same" Connected Component getting the same label.
